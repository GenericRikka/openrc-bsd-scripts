On this branch, i want to create a tool to automatically convert rc.d scripts to openrc, since the conversion follows a simple algorithm, it should not be too difficult to implement and will help me to get used with C again, so here goes nothing.

After some time i am able to say, that this really is a good project to get back into C, i am a lot more confident about my C coding abilities than before this project. That being said in hindsight it was not that good of an idea to use C instead of C++, due to probably more maintenance effort, since the code to achieve the same result is longer in C than in C++
So when i am done developing this project in C, i will most likely start to convert it into C++ afterwards. This will also be a good practice, to in turn get into C++ again. At least if i don't just come up with a new project, but who knows.

Sorry for not being as active with development on this branch as i used to be, i am currently facing some personal problems, but i hope i will be able to return to my main activity level soon, though currently stuff is still ongoing...

<b>Also:</b> <i>Please don't just push to this branch, i am actively working on it. If you want to help me with the development on this branch, please file an issue and i will reply asap. Then you might get an invitation to mumble & irc, to coordinate development.</i>
